    This class is more just for nicer import structure; everything is a static method.
    That meaning, the methods do not belong to an _instance_ of the class, but rather the class itself.

    (If you think about the class as an object instance of 'Class' itself, then a static method is like a instance method on that class. Now you're thinking with ~~portals~~ classes!)
